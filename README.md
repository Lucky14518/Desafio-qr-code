## My process:
The process was a bit challenging in terms of learning how to use Figma, but with practice, it was possible to develop the project with relative ease, using the concepts of Flexbox and semantic HTML.
### Build with:

- HTML5 
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I Learn?

This project allowed me to review several concepts I had studied over the years, and I was able to recall and use flexbox concepts without the assistance of AI. I also understood which code I should use and how I should divide the content. Often, I had to "rack my brain" for this, but I gained valuable experience.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that I can then master React and beyond. Finally, I plan to get a job and study backend development after these initial steps.
